# 1. The Digital Image

## 1.1 What is an image?

### Image as a 2D signal

The **signal** is a function depending on some variable with physical meaning. The **image** is a continuous function, where we either have 2 variables `x y` which are the coordinates, or, in case of a video, three variables `x y` and the corresponding time in the video. Usually, the value of the function is the **brightness**.

_Images in Python:_

```python
    # Load a picture into Python
    import cv2
    img = cv2.imread('foo.jpg')

    # Display the image in Python
    cv2.imshow('My image', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)

    # Print the image data array
    img

    # Print the size of the image array and create a subimage
    img.shape
    subimg = img[72:92, 62:82]
```

```python
    # Random image in Python
    import numpy as np
    import cv2
    t = np.random.rand(64, 64)
    cv2.imshow('Random', t)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
```

In summary, an **image** is a picture or pattern of a value varying in space and/or time. It is the representation of a _continuous_ function to a _discrete_ domain: `f : R^n -> S`.

As an example, for grayscale CCD images, `n = 2` and `S = R^+`.

### What is a pixel?

_A pixel is not a little square!_

**Pixels** are point measurements of a function (of the above described continuous function).

## 1.2 Where do images come from?

There are several things where pictures can come from:

- Digital cameras
- MRI scanners
- Computer graphics packages
- Body scanners
- Many more...

### Digital cameras

Simplified, the **digital camera** consists of the following parts and is said to be a _Charge Coupled Device (CCD)_:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-1.PNG)

The **sensor array** can be < 1Â cm^2 and is an array of _photosites_. Each photosite is a bucket of electrical charge, and this charge is proportional to the incident light intensity during the exposure.

The **analog to digital conversion (ADC)** measure the charge and digitizes the result. The conversion happens line by line in that charges in each photosite move down through the sensor array.

Example:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-2.PNG)

Because each bucket has a finite capacity, if a photosite bucket is full, it can overflow to other buckets, which leads to **blooming**.

Even without any light, there will still be some current which can degrade the quality of a picture. CCD's produce thermally-generated charge, which results in a _non-zero output_ even in darkness. This effect is called the **dark current**.

## 1.3 CMOS

**CMOS** sensors have the same sensor elements as CCD. Each photo sensor has its own amplifier, which results in more noise and a lower sensitivity. However, since CMOS photo sensor use standard CMOS technology, we might put other components on the chip (such as "smart pixels").

### CCD vs. CMOS

_CCD_

- Mature technology
- Specific technology
- High production cost
- High power consumption
- Blooming
- Sequential readout

_CMOS_

- More recent technology
- Cheap
- Lower power consumption
- Less sensitive
- Per pixel amplification
- Random pixel access
- On chip integration with other components

### Rolling shutter

By resetting each line in the sensor line by line (the "shutter"), each line will start capturing light a little before the line below and so on. Each line in the picture is therefore a little behind in time as the line above.

## 1.4 Sampling in 1D

**Sampling** in 1D takes a function, and returns a vector whose elements are values of that function at the sample points.

Example:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-3.PNG)

Sampling solves one problem with working with continuous functions. How do we store and compute with them? A common scheme for representing continuous functions is with **samples**: we simply write down the function's values as discrete values at many sample points.

### Reconstruction

**Reconstruction** describes the process of making samples back into a continuous function. We might do this for several reasons:

- For output where we need a realizable method
- For analysis or processing, where we need a mathematical method
- Instead of "guessing" what the function did in between sample points

### Undersampling

Unsurprisingly, if we undersample some function, we loose information.

Example: If we undersample the following `sin` wave, it gets indistinguishable from lower frequencies:

_Sample:_

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-4.PNG)

_Reconstruction 1:_

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-5.PNG)

_Reconstruction 2:_

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-6.PNG)

This effect is what we call **aliasing**, i.e. _"Signals travelling in disguise as other frequencies"_.

## 1.5 Sampling in 2D

**Sampling** in 2D takes a function and returns an array. We allow the array to be infinite dimensional and to have negative as well as positive indices.

Example:

_Function:_

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-7.PNG)

_Sample:_

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-8.PNG)

### Reconstruction

In 2D, a simple way to reconstruct a function from a sample is to use **bilinear interpolation**, which works essentially the same as linear interpolation: we calculate two lines in each direction, and then take the intersection of the two lines.

Example:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-9.PNG)

## 1.6 Nyquist Frequency

We define the **Nyquist Frequency** as half the sampling frequency of a discrete signal processing system. The concept tells us, that if the signal's maximum frequency is at most the Nyquist frequency, then we can reconstruct the signal.

## 1.7 Quantization

When sampling, real valued functions will get digital values, i.e. integer values. This means that **quantization** is lossy: after quantization, the original signal cannot be reconstructed anymore.

This is in contrast to sampling, as a sampled but not quantized signal _can_ be reconstructed.

### Usual quantization intervals

The following are the most widely used quantization intervals:

- Grayscale image: `8 bit = 2^8 = 256` gray values
- Color image RGB (3 channels): `8 bit/channel = 2^24 = 16.7M` colors
- 12 bit or 16 bit for some sensors

## 1.8 Image Properties

### Image resolution

Simply tells the amount of pixels our pictures has.

### Geometric resolution

_How many pixels per area?_

Tells us how many pixels we have per a given area (e.g. how many pixels per square centimeter of picture).

### Radiometric resolution

_How many bits per pixel?_

Tells us how much information each pixel can store.

## 1.9 Image Noise

A common model is the **additive Gaussian noise**, which means that we measure some signal with our processor but have some deviation/noise in our measurement:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-10.PNG)

One might also use the much more meaningful assumption of **Poisson noise**:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig1-11.PNG)

### SNR

The **signal to noise ration (SNR)** `s` is an index of image quality:

## 1.10 Color Cameras

We consider three different common concepts:

1. Prism (with three different sensors)
2. Filter mosaic
3. Filter wheel

### Prism

With this type of camera, we separate the light into three beams using two _dichroic prisms_. However, this requires three sensors and a very precise alignment. The plus of this concept is that there is a very good color separation.

### Filter Mosaic

With this concept, one coats the filter directly on the sensor.

### Filter wheel

For static scenes, we can rotate multiple filters in front of the lens. This allows for more than 3 colors.

### Prism vs. mosaic vs. wheel

| Approach   | Prism            | Mosaic          | Wheel                   |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| # Sensors  | 3                | 1               | 1                       |
| Separation | High             | Average         | Good                    |
| Cost       | High             | Low             | Average                 |
| Framerate  | High             | High            | Low                     |
| Artefacts  | Low              | Aliasing        | Motion                  |
| Bands      | 3                | 3               | 3 or more               |
| Type       | High-end cameras | Low-end cameras | Scientific applications |

### Color CMOS sensor (Foveon's X3)

In contrast to a filter mosaic, we truly measure each color at each pixel, instead of either red, blue or green per pixel.

# 2. Image Segmentation

> Image segmentation is the ultimate classification problem. Once solved, Computer Vision is solved.

## 2.1 What is Image Segmentation?

**Image segmentation** partitions an image into regions of interest. It is the first stage in many automatic image analysis systems.

A _complete segmentation_ of an image `I` is a finite set of regions `R_1,..., R_N`, such that:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig2-2.PNG)

_Excluding dark pixels from an image:_

```python
    img = cv2.imread('BlobsIP.png') # An 8-bit image
    cv2.imshow('BlobsIP', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    img.shape --> [244 767 3]
    hist = np.histogram(img, bins=256)
    cv2.imshow('Histogram', hist)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.imshow('Mask', img[:,:,1] > 20)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
```

### Segmentation quality

The **quality** of a segmentation depends on what you want to do with it. Segmentation algorithms must be chosen and evaluated with an application in mind.

## 2.2 Thresholding

**Thresholding** is a simple segmentation process. It produces a binary image `B` by labeling each pixel in or out of the region of interest by comparison of the graylevel with a threshold `T`:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig2-3.PNG)

### How do we choose T?

There are several ways to choose `T`:

- Trial and error
- Compare results with ground truth
- Automatic methods (we'll discuss ROC curves later on)

## 2.3 Chromakeying

If we can control the background of a picture, segmentation becomes easier. Assume we use a green screen.

**Chromakeying** describes the process of plain distance measuring, in this case for green:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig2-4.PNG)

This has some problems:

- Variation is _not_ the same in all three channels
- The alpha mask is hard: `I_comp = I_alpha I_a + (1 - I_alpha) I_b`

### Background color variation

Colors in the background may vary a lot (especially the intensity of colors and especially of green).

On way which can make segmentation easier is to **normalize colors** (per pixel):

- Intensity `I = R + G + B`
- Normalized color `(r, g, b) = (R/I, G/I, B/I)`

## 2.4 ROC Analysis

A **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)** curve characterizes the performance of a binary classifier. A binary classifier distinguishes between two different types of things, e.g.:

- Healty/afflicted patients
- Pregnancy tests
- Object detection
- Foreground/background image pixels

### Classification errors

Binary classifiers make errors. There are two types of input to a binary classifier:

- positives
- negatives

This results in four possible outcomes in any test:

- True positive
- True negative
- _False negative_
- _False positive_

### ROC Curve

The **ROC curve** characterizes the error trade-off in binary classification tasks. It plots the TP fraction against the FP fraction:

- _TP fraction_ (**sensitivity**) is `True positive count / positive count`
- _FP fraction_ (1-sensitivity) is `False positive count / negative count`

The result could look something like this:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig2-5.PNG)

### Operating points

We can choose an **operating point** by assigning relative costs and values to each outcome:

- `V_TN`: value of true negative
- `V_TP`: value of true positive
- `C_FN`: cost of false negative
- `C_FP`: cost of false positive

When we assigned these costs, we can choose the point on the ROC curve with **gradient**:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig2-6.PNG)

For simplicity, we often set `V_TN = V_TP = 0`.

## 2.5 Limits of Thresholding

Why can we segment images much better by eye than through thresholding processes? Because we can consider the context of the whole image.

We might improve results by considering _image context_ through **surface coherence**.

## 2.6 Pixels

### Pixel connectivity

We need to define which pixels are connected/neighbors.

We define two different types of **pixel neighborhoods**:

![](./Figures/VisComp_Fig2-7.PNG)

### Pixel paths

A **4-connected path** between pixels `p_1` and `p_n` is a set of pixels `{p_1, p_2,..., p_n}` such that `p_i` is a 4-neighbor of `p_i+1`.

In an **8-connected path**, `p_i` is an 8-neighbor of `p_i+1`.

### Connected regions

A region is 4-connected if it contains a 4-connected path between any two of its pixels. Analog, a region is 8-connected if it contains an 8-connected path between any two of its pixels.

## 2.7 Region growing

**Region growing** is defined by the following steps:

1. Start from a seed point/pixel or region
2. Add neighboring pixels that satisfy the criteria defining the region
3. Repeat until we can include no more pixels

In code, this could look like the following example:

```python
def regionGrow(I, seed) :
    X, Y = I.shape
    visited = np.zeros((X, Y))
    visited[seed] = 1
    boundary = []
    boundary.append(seed)

    while len(boundary) > 0 :
            nextPoint = boundary.pop()
            # Here is the important function which defines the region criteria
            if include(nextPoint, seed) :
                visited[nextpoint] = 2
                for (x, y) in neighbors(nextPoint) :
                    if visted[x, y] == 0 :
                        boundary.append((x, y))
                        visited [x, y] = 1
```

### Variations

There are three key indicators which lead to variation:

- Seed selection
- Inclusion criteria
- Boundary constraints and snakes

**Seed selection** can happen in different ways. This may be either by hand (point and click), or automatically by conservative thresholding.

The **inclusion criteria** could either be done by greylevel thresholding or by a _greylevel distribution model_:

- Use mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma` in seed region and then:
  - include if `(I(x, y) - mu)^2 < (n sigma)^2` (with for example `n = 3`)
  - this also leads to the ability to update the mean and standard deviation after every iteration
