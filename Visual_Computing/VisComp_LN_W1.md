# 1. The Digital Image

## 1.2 What is an image?

### Image as a 2D signal

The **signal** is a function depending on some variable with pyhsical meaning. The **image** is a continuous function, where we either have 2 variables `x y` which are the coordinates, or, in case of a video, three variables `x y` and the corresponding time in the video. Usually, the value of the function is the **brightness**.

*Images in Python:*

```python
    # Load a picture into Python
    import cv2
    img = cv2.imread('foo.jpg')

    # Display the image in Python
    cv2.imshow('My image', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)

    # Print the image data array
    img

    # Print the size of the image array and create a subimage
    img.shape
    subimg = img[72:92, 62:82]
```

```python
    # Random image in Python
    import numpy as np
    import cv2
    t = np.random.rand(64, 64)
    cv2.imshow('Random', t)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
```

In summary, an **image** is a picture or pattern of a value varying in space and/or time. It is the representation of a function `f : R^n -> S`.

As an example, for greyscale CCD images, `n = 2` and `S = R^+`.
