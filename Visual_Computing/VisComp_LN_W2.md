## 1.10 Color Cameras

We consider three different common concepts:

1. Prism (with three different sensors)
2. Filter mosaic
3. Filter wheel

### Prism

With this type of camera, we separate the light into three beams using two *dichroic prisms*. However, this requires three sensors and a very precise alignment. The plus of this concept is that there is a very good color separation.

### Filter Mosaic

With this concept, one coats the filter directly on the sensor.

### Filter wheel

For static scenes, we can rotate multiple filters in front of the lens. This allows for more than 3 colours.

### Prism vs. mosaic vs. wheel

| Approach   | Prism            | Mosaic          | Wheel                   |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| # Sensors  | 3                | 1               | 1                       |
| Separation | High             | Average         | Good                    |
| Cost       | High             | Low             | Average                 |
| Framerate  | High             | High            | Low                     |
| Artefacts  | Low              | Aliasing        | Motion                  |
| Bands      | 3                | 3               | 3 or more               |
| Type       | High-end cameras | Low-end cameras | Scientific applications |

### Color CMOS sensor (Foveon's X3)

In contrast to a filter mosaic, we truly measure each color at each pixel, instead of either red, blue or green per pixel.

# 2. Image Segmentation

> Image segmentation is the ultimate classification problem. Once solved, Computer Vision is solved.

## 2.1 What is Image Segmentation?

**Image segmentation** partitions an image into regions of interest. It is the first stage in many automatic image analysis systems.

A *complete segemtnation* of an image `I` is a finite set of regions `R_1,..., R_N`, such that:

*Excluding dark pixels from an image:*

```python
    img = cv2.imread('BlobsIP.png') # An 8-bit image
    cv2.imshow('BlobsIP', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    img.shape --> [244 767 3]
    hist = np.histogram(img, bins=256)
    cv2.imshow('Histogram', hist)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.imshow('Mask', img[:,:,1] > 20)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
```

### Segmentation quality

The **quality** of a segmentation depends on what you want to do with it. Segmentation algorithms must be chosen and evaluated with an application in mind.

## 2.2 Thresholding

**Thresholding** is a simple segmentation process. It produces a binary image `B` by labeling each pixel in or out of the region of interest by comparison of the graylevel with a threshold `T`:

### How do we choose T?

There are several different ways to choose `T`:

- Trial and error
- Compare results with ground truth
- Automatic methods (we'll discuss ROC curves later on)
