# 5. Fourier Transform

## 5.1 Introduction

The idea of the **Fourier Transform** is to represent functions in a new basis. We might think of functions as vectors, with many components, where we can apply a linear transformation to transform the basis (i.e. a dot product with each basis elements).

In the expressions, $u$ and $v$ select the basis elements, so a function of $x$ and $y$ becomes a function of $u$ and $v$. The **basis elements** have the form $e^{-i2 \pi (ux + vy)} = \cos 2 \pi (ux + vy) - i \sin 2 \pi (ux + vy)$. Or:

$$F(g(x, \, y))(u, \, v) = \int \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} g(x, \, y)e^{i2 \pi (ux + vy)}\text{d}x \text{dy}$$

The **discrete fourier transform** therefore is of the form:

$$F = Uf$$

where:

- $F$ is the transformed image
- $U$ is the Fourier transform base
- $f$ is the vectorized image
