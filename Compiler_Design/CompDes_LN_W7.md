# 9. Menhir In Practice

## 9.1 Menhir Output

You can get verbose ocamlyacc debugging information by doing:

```console
menhir --examplain
```

or, if using `ocamlbuild`:

```console
ocamlbuild -use-menhir -yaccflag --explain
```

The result is a `<basename>.conflicts` file describing the error. The flag `--dump` generates a full description of the automaton.

## 9.2 Precedence and Associativity Declarations

Parser generators often support **precedence/associativity declarations**. Those hint to the parser about how to resolve conflicts.

- Pros:
  - Avoids having to manually resolve those ambiguities by manually introducing extra non-terminals
  - Easier to maintain the grammar
- Cons:
  - Can't as easily re-use the same terminal
  - Introduces another level of debugging


# 10 Untyped Lambda Calculus

## 10.1 Functional Languages

Languages like ML, Haskell, Scheme, Python etc. support different operations on and with functions:

- Functions can be passed as arguments (e.g. `map` or `fold`)
- Functions can be returned as values (e.g. `compose`)
- Functions can be nested, i.e. inner functions refer to variables bound in the outer function

_Example:_

```ocaml
let add = fun x -> fun y -> x + y
let inc = add 1
let dec = add -1

let compose = fun f -> fun g -> fun x -> f (g x)
let id = compose inc dec
```

But how do we implement such functions in an interpreter or in a compiled language?

## 10.2 Lambda Calculus

The **lambda calculus** is a minimal programming language. It has variables, functions, and function application. That's it! It is, however, still touring complete.

The abstract syntax in OCaml is:

```ocaml
type exp =
    | Var of var        (* variables *)
    | Fun of var * exp  (* functions: fun x -> e *)
    | App of exp * exp  (* function application *)
```

The concrete syntax is:

```bnf
exp ::=
    | x
    | fun x -> exp
    | exp_1 exp_2
    | (exp)
```

## 10.3 Values and Substitution

The only **values** of the lambda calculus are (closed) functions:

```bnf
val ::=
    | fun x -> exp
```

To **substitute** value `v` for variable `x` in expression `e`:

- Replace all _free occurrences_ of `x` in `e` by `v`
- In OCaml written as `subst v x e`

Function application is interpreted by substitution:

```bnf
(fun x -> fun y -> x + y) 1
= subst 1 x (fun y -> x + y)
= (fun y -> 1 + y)
```

## 10.5 Free Variables and Scoping

We look at the following example code:

```ocaml
let add = fun x -> fun y -> x + y
let inc = add 1
```

The result of `add 1` is a function. After calling `add`, we can't throw away its arguments (or its local variables) because those are needed in the function returned by `add`.

- We say that variable `x` is **free** in `fun y -> x + y` (the variable is defined in the outer scope)
- We say that variable `y` is **bound** by `fun y`. Its scope is the body `x + y` in `fun y -> x + y`

A term with no free variables is called **closed**. In contrast, a term with one or more free variables is called **open**.

## 10.6 Free Variable Calculation

The following OCaml code computes the set of free variables in lambda expressions:

```ocaml
let rec free_vars (e:exp) : VarSet.t =
    begin match e with
        | Var x         -> VarSet.singleton x
        | Fun (x, body) -> VarSet.remove x (free_vars body)
        | App (e1, e2)  -> VarSet.union (free_vars e1) (free_vars e2)
    end
```

We then say a lambda expression `e` is _closed_ if `free_vars e` is `VarSet.empty`.

## 10.7 Variable Capture

Note that if we try to naively substitute an open term, a bound variable might **capture** the free variables. Example:

```bnf
(fun x -> (x y)) {(fun z -> x)/y}   // x is free in (fun z -> x)
= fun x -> (x (fun z -> x))         // the free x is now captured
```

This is usually not the desired behavior! The meaning of `x` is determined by where it is bound dynamically, not where it is bound statically (_dynamic scoping_).

## 10.8 Alpha Equivalence

Note that the names of bound variables don't matter. `(fun x -> y x)` is the same as `(fun z -> y z)`.
Two terms that differ only by consistent renaming of bound variables are called **alpha equivalent.**

However, the names of free variables do matter! `(fun x -> y x)` is not the same as `(fun x -> z x)`.

## 10.9 Fixing Substitution

We can fix the substitution problem. For this, let us consider the following substitution operation: $e_1{e_2/x}$

To avoid capture, we define the substitution to pick an alpha equivalent version of $e_1$, such that the bound names of $e_1$ don't mention the free names of $e_2$. Then we can do the simple naive substitution.

_Example:_

```bnf
(fun x -> (x y)) {(fun z -> x)/y}
= (fun x' -> (x' (fun z -> x)))     // rename x to x'
```
