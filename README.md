# ETH-CS-BA3SE1

Here I'll upload all summaries I make during the semester. Summaries will be in the course language.

I'll upload a PDF for each markdown file once I'm finished with the respective markdown file. However, I recommend downloading Visual Studio Code, cloning the repo and then work with the .md files instead (exporting .md to PDF still kinda sucks and the results are meh).

### Enjoyed My Summaries?

You can help me withstand all the pain I had with some courses by buying me a cup of coffee either at [BuyMeACoffe](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rwgs) or via [Twint!](https://rwgs.ch/twint.html)

Also, there are many more summaries over at [Ruben's Wery Good Site!](https://rwgs.ch)
